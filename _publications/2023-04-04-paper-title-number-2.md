In this project, we made a review on recent advancements in convective thermal metamaterials, where the state-of-the-art discoveries are classified into four sub-categories according to their functions, and a future prospect is cast on this field. In my opinion, the introduction of convection in the design of thermal metamaterials provides a new knob for controlling heat transfer beyond pure conduction, which allows active and robust thermal modulations. Besides, with the introduced convective effects, the hybrid diffusive system can be interpreted in a wave-like fashion, and revives many wave phenomena in dissipative diffusion.

* My work
  * Conducted literature review to learn about the conception, development history, and the state-of-the-art advancements of this research field.
  * Classified relevant research works into four sub-categories according to their functions, including enhancing heat transfer, porous-media-based thermal effects, nonreciprocal heat transfer, and non-Hermitian phenomena; Completed the paper draft.
  * Discussed the finished draft with tutors to enhance my understanding of this field, which also helps me gain a deeper insight into the connection between the diffusion systems (such as thermotics and electronics) and wave systems (such as acoustics and electromagnetics) at the macro level.
  * Published a review paper in [Advanced Materials](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202209123) as the first author.
