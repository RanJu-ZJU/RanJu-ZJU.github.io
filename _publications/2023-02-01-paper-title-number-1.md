In this project, we realized a flexible planar solar thermoelectric harvester that can harvest low-grade solar energy effectively under natural sunlight. With the synergy of materials properties, thermal management, and structure optimization, this device reaches a sustaining open-circuit voltage as significant as 20.

* My work:
  * Studied fundamental knowledge about thermoelectric effect, including Seebeck effect, Paltier effect, and Thompson effect, and familiarized with the classic works of thermal-energy harvesting.
  * Ran thermoelectric examples using COMSOL, deepened the understanding of the conditions under which various thermoelectric effects are arisen.
  * Established the mathematical model of heat transfer, optimized the structure of the thermoelectric chips through both analytical and numerical avenues, so that a higher harvest efficiency can be achieved.
  * Published a research paper in [APL Photonics](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/8/2/020801/2870735) as a co-author (Cover Article).
