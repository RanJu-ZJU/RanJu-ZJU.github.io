Thermal nonreciprocity typically stems from nonlinearity or spatiotemporal variation of parameters. However, constrained by the inherent temperature-dependent properties and the law of mass conservation, previous works were compelled to treat dynamic and steady-state cases separately. Here, by establishing a unified thermal scattering theory, we report the creation of a convection-based thermal meta-device which supports both dynamic and steady-state nonreciprocal heat circulation. We observe the non-trivial dependence between the nonreciprocal resonance peaks and the dynamic parameters, and reveal the unique nonreciprocal mechanism of multiple scattering at steady state. This mechanism enables thermal nonreciprocity in the initially quasi-symmetric scattering matrix of our three-port meta-device, and has been experimentally validated with a significant isolation ratio of heat fluxes. Our findings establish a framework for thermal nonreciprocity that can be smoothly modulated for dynamic and steady-state heat signals, it may also offer insight into other heat-transfer-related problems or even other fields such as acoustics and mechanics.

* My work
  * Conducted literature review to learn about the classic methods used to break the reciprocity of signal transmission, and had a knowledge of the advantages as well as deficiencies of these methods.
  * Constructed a wave-like theoretical framework for heat-transfer, and derived the scattering matrix for the thermal circulator.
  * Calculated the strength of nonreciprocity upon our thermal scattering theory, and exploited the non-trivial dependence of nonreciprocity on several model parameters.
  * Ran different calculation software, including MATLAB, MATHEMATICA, and COMSOL, to verify the consistency of results between theoretical and simulation models.
  * Perfected the thermal scattering theory to address the problem where nonreciprocity seems to vanish at the zero-frequency limit; revealed the physical nature, namely the diffraction and multiple scattering, of this counterintuitive phenomenon, and reflected on the difference between thermal and acoustic systems.
  * Looked up and ascertained the parameters of experimental model, then designed the platform and conducted a group of experiments successfully.
  * Submitted a research paper to Advanced Materials as the first author (under review).
