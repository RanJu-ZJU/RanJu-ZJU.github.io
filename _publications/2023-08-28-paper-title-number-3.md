To date, most nonreciprocal effects that have been realized are for the dynamic propagation of waves. The few studies on steady-state or static nonreciprocity, where the fields are constant in time, were carried out based on totally different design principles and concepts. Therefore, it remains a mystery whether the dynamic and steady-state nonreciprocity can share any common origin, and whether it is even possible to study them in the same framework. Here, we propose a thermal circulator which breaks both the dynamic and steady-state reciprocity of heat transfer using velocity field biasing. A unified thermal scattering theory is established to analyze both cases. The dynamic nonreciprocity is attributed to an asymmetric scattering matrix. Counterintuitively, this matrix approaches a symmetric limit at steady state, but still conveys a significant steady-state nonreciprocity. Our theory reveals this unique nonreciprocal mechanism of multiple scattering, and is experimentally verified with a large isolation ratio of heat fluxes. Being the first work to report thermal nonreciprocity induced by external biasing experimentally, it is expected to inspire novel approaches for thermal energy utilization and thermal management. It could also arouse broad interests on the unification of dynamic and steady-state phenomena in acoustics, mechanics, and electromagnetics.

* My work
  * Conducted literature review to learn about the classic methods used to break the reciprocity of signal transmission, and had a knowledge of the advantages as well as deficiencies of these methods.
  * Constructed a wave-like theoretical framework for heat-transfer, and derived the scattering matrix for the thermal circulator.
  * Calculated the strength of nonreciprocity upon our thermal scattering theory, and exploited the non-trivial dependence of nonreciprocity on several model parameters.
  * Ran different calculation software, including MATLAB, MATHEMATICA, and COMSOL, to verify the consistency of results between theoretical and simulation models.
  * Perfected the thermal scattering theory to address the problem where nonreciprocity seems to vanish at the zero-frequency limit; revealed the physical nature, namely the diffraction and multiple scattering, of this counterintuitive phenomenon, and reflected on the difference between thermal and acoustic systems.
  * Looked up and ascertained the parameters of experimental model, then designed the platform and conducted a group of experiments successfully.
  * Submitted a research paper to [Nature Communications] as the first author (under review).
