Hi, I'm a third year graduate student from Zhejiang University. My research interest includes heat transfer, wave propagation, and multi-physical effects.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ying Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yingli) and [Prof. Hongsheng Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/hongshengchen) from [College of Information Science & Electronic Engineering](http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/iseenglish/main.psp) of [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

On this website, you can learn about my educational experience, academic records, and life interests.
